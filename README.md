# Sales and Finance Analysis

This project provides sales and finance analysis reports based on data provided by Atliq Hardwares, a company that sells IT hardware such as mice, PCs, and other related products.  This project utilizes Excel spreadsheets enhanced with **Power Pivot** for data analysis and report generation.

## Description

This project offers valuable insights into Atliq Hardwares' sales and financial performance through pre-built Excel reports.  Leveraging the power of Power Pivot, the spreadsheets are designed to efficiently process and analyze datasets, providing key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and visualizations to support informed business decisions.  The reports cover a range of analyses, from sales performance by product category to detailed financial summaries.

## Usage

1. **Data Input Format:** The project requires input data in a specific format.  The structure of the data is illustrated in the `data_model.png` file. This diagram shows the tables, columns, and relationships expected in the input data.  *(Please provide details about the data types for each column, e.g., Date, Number, Text, Currency, etc.)*

2. **Data Acquisition:** The complete dataset used for these reports is proprietary and cannot be shared publicly.  To obtain access to the data, please contact Sparsh Goel at sparshgoel21@gmail.com.

3. **Opening the Reports:** Open the main Excel file, `Sales_Finance_Analysis.xlsx`, using Microsoft Excel (or a compatible spreadsheet software).  *It's recommended to have the latest version of Excel for optimal compatibility with Power Pivot features.*

4. **Navigating the Reports:** The Excel file contains multiple worksheets, each dedicated to a specific report or analysis. The main sheet, "Dashboard" (or whatever you name it), provides an overview of the key findings. The following reports are included:

*   **:** This report shows sales figures broken down by product category. It allows you to analyze which product categories are performing best. *(Please provide details about interactive elements like filters, pivot tables, etc.)*
*   **Revenue Over Time:** This report displays revenue trends over a specific period, allowing you to identify seasonal patterns and growth trends. *(Please provide details about time period selection and available visualizations.)*
*   **Profit Margins:** This report presents profit margin analysis, showing how profitable each product or product category is. *(Please provide details about specific metrics like gross profit margin, net profit margin, etc.)*
*   **Regional Sales Performance:** This report analyzes sales performance across different regions, helping identify strong and weak markets. *(Please provide details about regional comparisons or visualizations.)*
*   **Top Performing Products:** This report identifies the best-selling products based on various metrics like revenue, units sold, etc. *(Please provide details about the criteria used for identifying top performers.)*

*   **Financial Summary:** This report provides a high-level overview of financial performance, including key financial metrics and ratios. *(Please provide details about the key metrics included in the summary.)*

5. **Interacting with the Reports:** *(Please provide detailed instructions on how users can interact with the reports. Can they filter data? Are there any interactive charts or pivot tables? Give specific examples. Mention any Power Pivot-specific interactive features.)*

6. **Updating the Data:** To update the reports with new data, populate your own data according to the structure shown in `data_model.png`.  Then, within the Excel file, replace the existing data in the data input sheet (or linked data source) with your new data. Ensure your data adheres to the specified format and data types. The reports should automatically update (depending on how you've set up the Excel file).  *For large datasets, ensure your Excel settings are optimized for Power Pivot performance.*
